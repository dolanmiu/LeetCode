# Intuition
Have a bucket based system to keep track of the current nest level
It is a kind of linear traversal, keeping track of only the "next line", which could be any nest level! (Not quite, any nest level backwards, but only one forwards)

We then simply slice the array up to the specified point and join the buckets together
