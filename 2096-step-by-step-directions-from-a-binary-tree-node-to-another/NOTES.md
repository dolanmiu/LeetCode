# Straightforward
* This question requires you to know the LCA (Lowest common ancestor)
* Traverse the path for the begining and the end
* Where it deviates is where it will be the LCA
* Then it is simply a matter of setting all the letters of the `start path` to `U`, then connecting it with the `end path`
