* Using a trie based solution will be faster than a O(n * m) solution by checking every word and doing a `.startsWith()`
​
​
* First build a trie
* Then traverse the trie
* While traversing the trie, start building on the traversed word
* Return the word, and check it against a Set generated by the dictionary
* A condition is to short circuit the shortest found word. This is fine. Simply pass in the set into the traversal trie method and periodically check if a word has been matched in the set.
* If it has been matched, then short circuit and return the word early.
