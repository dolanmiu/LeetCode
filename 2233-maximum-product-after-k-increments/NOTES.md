* Bad wording of the question
* Need to mod everytime you multiply.
* Makes sense I guess... Otherwise there will be an overflow past a certain product
​
​
* Sort it, and then increment the values, but have a moving pointer
* During iteration of k, check if the current pointer still in the correct spot (if the next pointer is bigger.
* If the next number is bigger, then increment the pointer
* If the current pointer is larger or equal to than previous pointer, then we decrement the pointer
* KEY POINT, we need to do a while loop to potentially bring it back to the start of the array

Set the walls of the array as Number.MAX_VALUE
