* Multiple clean up steps before the main steps
* Clean up 1: While loop index to delete multiple spaces
* Clean up 2: Since now there are only singular spaces, check the front and end of the array to see if they are spaces. If so, delete
​
* Have a common  reverse function, which accepts start and end
* First, reverse the whole string
* Secondly, reverse sub sections in a second loop if the loop finds a ' '.
​
* Be sure to not mess up on the start and end indexes, it is tricky to loop through start and end and replace.
